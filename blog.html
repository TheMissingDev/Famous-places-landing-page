          <p class="c-p" id="c1-p1">
            The most famous and largest structure still standing from the Roman
            Empire, the Colosseum is also the biggest attraction of modern-day
            Rome. It's been a bucket-list destination of travelers for
            generations. And it does not disappoint. Set in the heart of the
            city, the Colosseum is an easy place to visit. Direct flights from
            around the world land in Rome daily, making it a destination you can
            visit in a weekend if you choose. Wander through Rome's ancient
            streets, tour the colosseum, and if time allows, plan a trip to
            other areas of Italy.

          <h1 class="c-h1" id="c2-h1">The Acropolis in Athens</h1>
          <p class="c-p" id="c2-p2">
            Perched above present day Athens, the Acropolis draws you up and in.
            Follow in the footsteps of the ancients as you walk up the same
            steps that have been walked on since 438 BC - 2,500 years. Views out
            over the city are incredible as you walk between the meticulously
            restored ancient buildings. Near the end of the day, you'll want to
            linger and watch the sunset from the stairs near the entrance. This
            is a nightly ritual in Athens. The site is also impressive looking
            up at it from the city below. Spend an evening dining on a rooftop
            patio to soak in the view of the hilltop ruins lit up at night.

          <p class="c-p" id="c2-p2">
            America is full of great sights and places to visit, but it's the
            Statue of Liberty that represents the United States like no other
            place. This symbol of freedom in New York City was gifted by the
            French to the American people in 1896. Of all the attractions in New
            York City, this is one every tourist must see. The best thing to do
            at the Statue of Liberty is to take a ride up to her crown and soak
            up the view over the city. Access to the statue is via ferry, also a
            highlight of a visit. If you don't have time for a tour, you can
            still see the statue without leaving Manhattan. Head to Battery Park
            for the best views. You can also see the Statue of Liberty on a free
            ride on the Staten Island Ferry. See our guide to touring New York
            City by water on the NYC Ferry System.

          <p class="c-p" id="c2-p2">
            You may have an Indiana Jones feeling as you walk through a
            1.2-kilometer-long narrow crack in the sandstone hills and emerge
            into a hidden city. First built over 2,000 years ago and lost to the
            outside world for 600 years, the city was only discovered in 1812.
            Stunning buildings are carved directly into the red rock walls and
            are wonderfully preserved, just begging to be explored and
            photographed. If you arrive early, an eerie silence, coupled with
            long shadows, give this abandoned city a special feel.

          <p class="c-p" id="c3-p1">
            The Taj Mahal is the one sight in India that all travelers need to
            see. The country is filled with incredible cities and fabulous
            places to visit, but the 17th-century Taj Mahal in Agra is the one
            place that says you've been to India. This mausoleum, commissioned
            by the Shah Jahan for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, is known
            internationally as a symbol of love. This fantastic structure, made
            with inlaid precious and semi-precious stones, has to be visited to
            be fully appreciated. Its riverfront setting, surrounding gardens,
            and reflecting pools are also what make the Taj Mahal so special.

          <h1 class="c-h1" id="c4-h1">Pyramids of Giza</h1>
          <p class="c-p" id="c4-p2">
            If you've visited places like the Colosseum in Rome or the Acropolis
            in Athens, built over 2,000 years ago, you may think you have a good
            handle on ancient sites. But the Pyramids of Giza take ancient to a
            whole other level. These were built over 4,500 years ago. Tourists
            were coming to see these magnificent structures literally thousands
            of years ago. Located just outside Cairo, the pyramids, which is
            also where you'll find the Sphinx, are easy to get to, and tours are
            easy to arrange. A sunset camel ride around the structures is a
            wonderful experience.

          <h1 class="c-h1" id="c2-h1">Great Wall of China</h1>
          <p class="c-p" id="c2-p2">
            In a land of modern cities and towering skyscrapers, the Great Wall
            of China, built between the 14th and 17th centuries, is a stark
            contrast but a striking image that all visitors to China should see.
            A stroll along the top of the wall provides an incredible view of
            the structure snaking off into the distance. The wall stretches an
            astounding 21,196 kilometers, through some remote areas. Many
            travelers seeing the sights of China choose to visit the wall on
            easily organized tours from Beijing, a relatively short motorcoach
            ride away.

          <p class="c-p" id="c2-p2">
            Stonehenge is one of those places that makes you ponder what went on
            here over 4,500 years ago. It's long been a mystery to historians,
            and has captured the imagination of countless visitors. Despite the
            large number of tourists that descend on Stonehenge, the place still
            has a mystical feel. At the site, giant stones, some standing, some
            fallen, are set in two roughly circular patterns that are oriented
            to highlight the summer and winter solstices. For a truly memorable
            experience, plan your visit during one of these times. An easy day
            trip from London, Stonehenge can easily be worked into your UK
            itinerary.
